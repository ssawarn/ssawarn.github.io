- I am currently a doctoral student in the [Quantum Interfaces group](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/exphys/research/quantum-interfaces/) at Universität Innsbruck.

- My research focuses on the experimental demonstration of quantum network using <sup>40</sup>Ca<sup>+</sup> ion-cavity sytem.

- Previously, I was a research intern at the [Quantum and Science Technology lab](https://www.prl.res.in/~rpsingh/QSTProgram/index.html) at the Physical Research Laboratory.

- I hold a Master's degree in Physics from [Hindu College](https://hinducollege.ac.in) and a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from [Jamia Millia Islamia](https://jmi.ac.in).

- Born and raised in Bihar, India, I have journeyed from Patna to Delhi and now to Innsbruck.
