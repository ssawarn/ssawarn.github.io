	abstract = {The Mach-Zehnder interferometer is a simple device that demonstrates the clear path-choice problem in quantum mechanics through amplitude division. Experiments carried out in labs often encounter noise due to component inefficiencies and other environmental factors. The present study maps the interferometer and its inherent inefficiencies to a quantum circuit using Qiskit. This work highlights the crucial role of quantum error correction (QEC) protocols in managing the noise present in the quantum circuit. By employing the Shor code, an error-correcting code devised by Peter Shor, it becomes feasible to detect and rectify errors.},

	doi = {10.21203/rs.3.rs-3285321/v1},
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a computationally efficient method to solve the Schrödinger equation for hydrogen atoms using atomic units. The method incorporates the Numerov-Cooley Shooting Method, a well-known fourth-order method, to attain high precision solutions. Coupled with the Cooley\&\#039;s Energy correction formula, the method achieves rapid convergence to accurate energy eigenvalues. With defined boundary conditions, this method enables efficient computation of the radial probability density for atoms. The method is implemented using FORTRAN 90/95, a language favored for its computational efficiency. The results are represented through various hydrogen states, providing a detailed understanding of their energy associations. Additionally, data visualization tools like matplotlib are employed for effective representation of these outputs. The method presented introduces a proficient approach for solving complex equations in quantum mechanics and can potentially be extended to other atomic systems.},
