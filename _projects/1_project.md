* Guide: [Prof. Dr. R.P. Singh](https://www.prl.res.in/~rpsingh/), Head, Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics(AMOPH) Division, Physical Research Laboratory

* Worked on ’Effect of turbulence on key-rate in BB84 protocol’ experimentally under a team setting.

* Worked on three node quantum network simulation and hands-on experimental techniques in Quantum Optics Lab.

* Simulated Budget link equation for generation of key rate in BB84 and Quantum Networks.

* Familiarized myself with a variety of quantum network simulators such as QKDNetSim, QuISP, NetSquid, QuNetSim, SQUANCH, SeQUeNCe and SimulaQron and chose SeQUeNCe for its flexibility and scalability.  

* Analyzed the BB84 protocol within the SeQUeNCe simulator, conducting an in-depth study on throughput, error rates and latency which offered valuable insights into the potential and restrictions of quantum networks


* [Progress report](https://ssawarn.github.io/assets/pdf/2023_SIP_Shivam.pdf)(<i>until 10 July</i>)
