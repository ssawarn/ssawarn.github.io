- Completed project after concluding IBM QAMP Fall'22 and Spring'23 along with 5 collaborators.

- Worked out on proofreading of Unitary and non-Unitary part of Open Quantum Systems Dynamics and on different noise models including Markovian and non- Markovian noises.

- Responsible for applying different protection and recovery reward of the agent required for reinforcement learning of the non-unitary part of Schrodinger equation.

- Applied simple instances of open system on models like Quantum Boltzmann Machine(QBM) which showed perfect match between the probability generated and expected.

- Worked on solving complex quantum open system through QITE models.

- Submitted checkpoints on [Github](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-fall-22/issues/35) for fulfilment of the project.
